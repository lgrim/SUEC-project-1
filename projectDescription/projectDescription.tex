\section{Description} The goal of this project is to create a software package that will take xml files containing data from endurance/strength tests completed by athletes, and create a detailed report including but not limited to the athlete's training zones, graphical representations of the data, and analysis of the athlete's performance related to other athletes in that age group.

\section{Initial Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a git repository to share, track, and update the software package
	\item Write the code that will transform the xml file into a csv file, where each column is an attribute. Each row should contain all attributes related to the given data object (a moment in time). 
	\item Begin building the report template and explore using R in combination with python for data analysis and plotting.
	\item ...?
